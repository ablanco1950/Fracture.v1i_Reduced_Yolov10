# Fracture.v1i_Reduced_Yolov10
From a selection of data from the Roboflow file https://universe.roboflow.com/landy-aw2jb/fracture-ov5p1/dataset/1, which represents a reduced but homogeneous version of that file, a model is obtained based on yolov10 with that custom dataset to indicate fractures in x-rays.
